From a pale blue rosary
From the presents I would leave
Underneath your pillow
Underneath your pillow
From there to here
From there to here
From a pale blue rosary to here
You don't need a reason to call
You don't need a reason to call
Could I have made it clearer
Made it any clearer
What was going on with me?
How see-through must I have been?
From the start you felt like home
I lost that sense of being alone
Through streets dark and empty
You held me in a taxi
How I needed to be held
Needed you between me and the world
I tried so hard not to give in
I tried to do the right thing
Whatever I was saying
Maybe I was hoping
We would get from there to here
From a pale blue rosary to here
