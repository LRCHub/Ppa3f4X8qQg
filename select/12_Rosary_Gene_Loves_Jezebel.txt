Sometimes when I cry
I'm like a child
Sometimes I know no reason why
Cos if I get too close I'm so far
So far, so far from where you are
Sometimes I stumble, I fall
Baby, baby
Let me roll
Just let me roll...
You've got the rhythm of a river
That's how you move
Dancing on the water
How could you lose
But, I can't seem to touch who you are
Who you are god only knows
Let me roll
Please let me roll
Cross your heart
Cross your hands
Wait until something comes along
And gives you a gift
A Rosary
Made me of stone
It's been blessed by some Father
It's a gift from the Son
The only one
Let me roll it yeah
Let me be the one
